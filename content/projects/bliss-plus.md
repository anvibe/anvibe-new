We set out to create more than just a good-looking brand — we built an identity with intention. Through a complete visual refresh, paired with bold, personality-driven copy and a clear, strategic narrative, we gave Bliss a brand that didn't just turn heads, but told a story worth remembering.

## Global Brand Transformation

The transformation encompassed every touchpoint of the Bliss brand, from visual identity to brand voice. We created a cohesive system that resonated with their target audience while maintaining the innovative spirit that made Bliss unique.
